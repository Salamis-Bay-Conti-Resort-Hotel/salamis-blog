  <p>
    When you start looking around, you will notice that the most special items are the ones that feel connected to the earth and the history here.
    If you want to know what souvenirs to buy in Cyprus, start with the symbols of the island.
    The mouflon, a shy wild sheep found only in our mountains, is a favorite.
    You can find its image on high-quality ceramics or hand-painted ornaments that look great on any shelf.
  </p>

  <p>
    Copper is another important symbol. The island was one of the ancient world’s primary copper sources,
    and you can still find local craftsmen creating decorative bowls and ornaments today.
    The best souvenirs from Cyprus are these little pieces of history.
    They are not just objects — they are stories waiting to be shared.
