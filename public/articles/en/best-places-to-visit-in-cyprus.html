        <p>
          Just a short drive up into the mountains from Girne, you will find the village of Bellapais. It is home to the
          stunning Bellapais Abbey, a 13th-century masterpiece of Gothic architecture. The name itself means "The Abbey of
          Peace," and you will understand why the moment you step inside. This is truly one of Cyprus's best places to visit
